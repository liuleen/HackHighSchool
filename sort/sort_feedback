ex00 was pretty hard, i don't even think my code works fully. I think it's a good exercise still though because it's math concepts that they already know how to solve but to implement coding with it, will be challenging. The challenging part was using the commandline argv's and use it as arrays

ex01 was easier than ex00. swap it!
