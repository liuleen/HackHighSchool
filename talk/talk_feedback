Create a program which contains a secret five-letter word. When the program runs, it tells the user what letter the word starts with and invites the user to guess.

	-Warren had problems understanding this, he didnâ€™t know we had to create our own secret word. He was trying to figure out what the secret word is haha
	-So maybe more clarity here? I had no issue but i guess if warren had trouble some of the other kids would as well
