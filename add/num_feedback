Ex00 was pretty straighforward, not too confusing, but challenging enought to teach me some new concepts and syntax

It was a fun exercise. Not that hard. 

Ex01 was reeeeaally easy, maybe too easy. I like that it makes me check different edge cases because that's important when it comes to coding

ex02 is a cool way to introduce how prime numbers work, it's a quite useful thing to know when you are doing algorithmic problems in other problems that require odd/even thinking.
